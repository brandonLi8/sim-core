/**
 * ScreenView is the top-level view portion for the each individual Screen of the simulation. Run the simulation with
 * the `?dev` query parameter to see the outline of each ScreenView.
 *
 * ## Coordinates
 * It is important to note that ScreenView coordinates are not in pixels. The browser width and height (which are in
 * pixels) change from device to device and the window size may shrink or grow.
 *
 * Instead, ScreenView has its own coordinate system (termed 'scenery coordinates') that doesn't depend on the window
 * size. All Node's use this coordinate system. The layout() then changes the actual CSS pixel coordinates based off a
 * scalar of the window width and height, which is defined as the max scalar such that the entire ScreenView fits
 * inside the window without ratio changes.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * To use a ScreenView for a simulation Screen, you must create a sub-class of the ScreenView. A sub-class is needed
 * since you need to pass the class (not an instance) to the Screen. The ScreenView sub-class will be instantiated
 * in Screen (during the loading process) and the top-level model for the Screen will be passed in. See Screen.js
 * for more documentation. ScreenView is a abstract class with no abstract methods (meaning it must be sub-typed).
