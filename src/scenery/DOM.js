 * A node for the Scenery scene graph. Supports general directed acyclic graphics (DAGs).
 * Handles multiple layers with assorted types (Canvas 2D, SVG, DOM, WebGL, etc.).
 *
 * ## General description of Nodes
 *
 * In Scenery, the visual output is determined by a group of connected nodes (generally known as a scene graph).
 * Each node has a list of 'child' nodes. When a node is visually displayed, its child nodes (children) will also be
 * displayed, along with their children, etc. There is typically one 'root' node that is passed to the Scenery Display
 * whose descendants (nodes that can be traced from the root by child relationships) will be displayed.
 *
 * For instance, say there are nodes named A, B, C, D and E, who have the relationships:
 * - B is a child of A (thus A is a parent of B)
 * - C is a child of A (thus A is a parent of C)
 * - D is a child of C (thus C is a parent of D)
 * - E is a child of C (thus C is a parent of E)
 * where A would be the root node. This can be visually represented as a scene graph, where a line connects a parent
 * node to a child node (where the parent is usually always at the top of the line, and the child is at the bottom):
 * For example:
 *
 *   A
 *  / \
 * B   C
 *    / \
 *   D   E
 *
 * Additionally, in this case:
 * - D is a 'descendant' of A (due to the C being a child of A, and D being a child of C)
 * - A is an 'ancestor' of D (due to the reverse)
 * - C's 'subtree' is C, D and E, which consists of C itself and all of its descendants.
 *
 * Note that Scenery allows some more complicated forms, where nodes can have multiple parents, e.g.:
 *
 *   A
 *  / \
 * B   C
 *  \ /
 *   D
 *
 * In this case, D has two parents (B and C). Scenery disallows any node from being its own ancestor or descendant,
 * so that loops are not possible. When a node has two or more parents, it means that the node's subtree will typically
 * be displayed twice on the screen. In the above case, D would appear both at B's position and C's position. Each
 * place a node would be displayed is known as an 'instance'.
 *
 * Each node has a 'transform' associated with it, which determines how its subtree (that node and all of its
 * descendants) will be positioned. Transforms can contain:
 * - Translation, which moves the position the subtree is displayed
 * - Scale, which makes the displayed subtree larger or smaller
 * - Rotation, which displays the subtree at an angle
 * - or any combination of the above that uses an affine matrix (more advanced transforms with shear and combinations
 *   are possible).
 *
 * Say we have the following scene graph:
 *
 *   A
 *   |
 *   B
 *   |
 *   C
 *
 * where there are the following transforms:
 * - A has a 'translation' that moves the content 100 pixels to the right
 * - B has a 'scale' that doubles the size of the content
 * - C has a 'rotation' that rotates 180-degrees around the origin
 *
 * If C displays a square that fills the area with 0 <= x <= 10 and 0 <= y <= 10, we can determine the position on
 * the display by applying transforms starting at C and moving towards the root node (in this case, A):
 * 1. We apply C's rotation to our square, so the filled area will now be -10 <= x <= 0 and -10 <= y <= 0
 * 2. We apply B's scale to our square, so now we have -20 <= x <= 0 and -20 <= y <= 0
 * 3. We apply A's translation to our square, moving it to 80 <= x <= 100 and -20 <= y <= 0
 *
 * Nodes also have a large number of properties that will affect how their entire subtree is rendered, such as
 * visibility, opacity, etc.
 *
 * ## Creating nodes
 *
 * Generally, there are two types of nodes:
 * - Nodes that don't display anything, but serve as a container for other nodes (e.g. Node itself, HBox, VBox)
 * - Nodes that display content, but ALSO serve as a container (e.g. Circle, Image, Text)
 *
 * When a node is created with the default Node constructor, e.g.:
 *   var node = new Node();
 * then that node will not display anything by itself.
 *
 * Generally subtypes of Node are used for displaying things, such as Circle, e.g.:
 *   var circle = new Circle( 20 ); // radius of 20
 *
 * Almost all nodes (with the exception of leaf-only nodes like Spacer) can contain children.
 *
 * ## Connecting nodes, and rendering order
 *
 * To make a 'childNode' become a 'parentNode', the typical way is to call addChild():
 *   parentNode.addChild( childNode );
 *
 * To remove this connection, you can call:
 *   parentNode.removeChild( childNode );
 *
 * Adding a child node with addChild() puts it at the end of parentNode's list of child nodes. This is important,
 * because the order of children affects what nodes are drawn on the 'top' or 'bottom' visually. Nodes that are at the
 * end of the list of children are generally drawn on top.
 *
 * This is generally easiest to represent by notating scene graphs with children in order from left to right, thus:
 *
 *   A
 *  / \
 * B   C
 *    / \
 *   D   E
 *
 * would indicate that A's children are [B,C], so C's subtree is drawn ON TOP of B. The same is true of C's children
 * [D,E], so E is drawn on top of D. If a node itself has content, it is drawn below that of its children (so C itself
 * would be below D and E).
 *
 * This means that for every scene graph, nodes instances can be ordered from bottom to top. For the above example, the
 * order is:
 * 1. A (on the very bottom visually, may get covered up by other nodes)
 * 2. B
 * 3. C
 * 4. D
 * 5. E (on the very top visually, may be covering other nodes)
 *
 * ## Trails
 *
 * For examples where there are multiple parents for some nodes (also referred to as DAG in some code, as it represents
 * a Directed Acyclic Graph), we need more information about the rendering order (as otherwise nodes could appear
 * multiple places in the visual bottom-to-top order.
 *
 * A Trail is basically a list of nodes, where every node in the list is a child of its previous element, and a parent
 * of its next element. Thus for the scene graph:
 *
 *   A
 *  / \
 * B   C
 *  \ / \
 *   D   E
 *    \ /
 *     F
 *
 * there are actually three instances of F being displayed, with three trails:
 * - [A,B,D,F]
 * - [A,C,D,F]
 * - [A,C,E,F]
 * Note that the trails are essentially listing nodes used in walking from the root (A) to the relevant node (F) using
 * connections between parents and children.
 *
 * The trails above are in order from bottom to top (visually), due to the order of children. Thus since A's children
 * are [B,C] in that order, F with the trail [A,B,D,F] is displayed below [A,C,D,F], because C is after B.
 *
 * ## Events
 *
 * There are a number of events that can be triggered on a Node (usually when something changes or happens). Currently
 * Node effectively inherits the Events type, and thus has the on()/off() and onStatic()/offStatic() methods for
 * handling these types of event listeners. It is generally preferred to use the "static" forms, which have improved
 * performance (but come with the restriction that a listener being fired should NOT trigger any listeners getting
 * added or removed as a side-effect).
 *
 * The following events are exposed non-Scenery usage:
 *
 * - childrenChanged - This is fired only once for any single operation that may change the children of a Node. For
 *                     example, if a Node's children are [ a, b ] and setChildren( [ a, x, y, z ] ) is called on it,
 *                     the childrenChanged event will only be fired once after the entire operation of changing the
 *                     children is completed.
 * - selfBounds - This event can be fired synchronously, and happens with the self-bounds of a Node is changed.
 * - childBounds - This is fired asynchronously (usually as part of a Display.updateDisplay()) when the childBounds of
 *                 the node is changed.
 * - localBounds - This is fired asynchronously (usually as part of a Display.updateDisplay()) when the localBounds of
 *                 the node is changed.
 * - bounds - This is fired asynchronously (usually as part of a Display.updateDisplay()) when the bounds of the node is
 *            changed.
 * - transform - Fired synchronously when the transform (transformation matrix) of a Node is changed. Any change to a
 *               Node's translation/rotation/scale/etc. will trigger this event.
 * - visibility - Fired synchronously when the visibility of the Node is toggled.
 * - opacity - Fired synchronously when the opacity of the Node is changed.
 * - pickability - Fired synchronously when the pickability of the Node is changed
 * - clip - Fired synchronously when the clipArea of the Node is changed.
 *
 * While the following are considered scenery-internal and should not be used externally:
 *
 * - childInserted - For a single added child Node.
 * - childRemoved - For a single removed child Node.
 * - childrenReordered - Provides a given range that may be affected by the reordering
 * - localBoundsOverride - When the presence/value of the localBounds override is changed.
 * - inputEnabled - When the inputEnabled property is changed.
 * - rendererBitmask - When this node's bitmask changes (generally happens synchronously to other changes)
 * - hint - Fired synchronously when various hints change
 * - addedInstance - Fires when an Instance is added to the Node.
 * - removedInstance - Fires when an Instance is removed from the Node.
